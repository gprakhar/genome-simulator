Code base for Genome simulator
This pipeline has been written in R and Python.
It takes as input a codon usage frequency file and a file with Nucleotide content of genome and lenght of genome and a gff file with list of genes 

Using the data from the two input files it generates a simulated genome, contrained by the parameters of the input files
